**Description :**

 1. The first boss to enter will be activated immediately and can approve the rest of the bosses and doctors
 2. Doctors and Inactive bosses will not be able to complete their profiles unless approved by active bosses (Pay attention : The profile section of the bosses has not been completed yet)
 3. Create an .env file to configure and fill in the information like an .env.example file.
 4. Because I first used another query builder and then had to use Medoo query builder, I used two different query builders in the code.
 5. Due to the presence of migration files, database tables are created automatically after running the program
